# STICKY-NOTES-APPLICATION
I created a Sticky Notes application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering features to create, edit, save, and delete notes. With a simple and intuitive interface, it ensures notes are saved in persistent storage, making them accessible even after refreshing the page. This tool is perfect for managing tasks, reminders, or ideas efficiently.
